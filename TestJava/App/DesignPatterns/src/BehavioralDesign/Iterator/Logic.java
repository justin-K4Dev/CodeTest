/*
    Iterator Pattern

    Iterator pattern is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment.

    This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner
    without any need to know its underlying representation.

    Iterator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

    Implementation

    We're going to create a Iterator interface which narrates navigation method
    and a Container interface which retruns the iterator.

    Concrete classes implementing the Container interface will be responsible to implement Iterator interface and use it

    IteratorPatternDemo, our demo class will use NamesRepository,
    a concrete class implementation to print a Names stored as a collection in NamesRepository.
