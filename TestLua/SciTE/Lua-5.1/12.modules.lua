	12.1 What is a Module ?
]]
	-- Module is like a library that can be loaded using require and has a single global name containing a table.
	-- This module can consist of a number of functions and variables.
	-- All these functions and variables are wrapped in to the table which acts as a namespace.
	-- Also a well behaved module has necessary provisions to return this table on require.

--[[
	12.2 Specialty of Lua Modules
]]
	-- The usage of tables in modules helps us in numerous ways
	-- and enables us to manipulate the modules in the same way we manipulate any other Lua table.
	-- As a result of the ability to manipulate modules,
	-- it provides extra features for which other languages need special mechanisms.
	-- Due to this free mechanism of modules in Lua,
	-- a user can call the functions in Lua in multiple ways.
	-- A few of them are shown below.

		-- Assuming we have a module printFormatter
		-- Also printFormatter has a funtion simpleFormat(arg)
		-- Method 1
		require "printFormatter"
		printFormatter.simpleFormat("test")

		-- Method 2
		local formatter = require "printFormatter"
		formatter.simpleFormat("test")

		-- Method 3
		require "printFormatter"
		local formatterFunction = printFormatter.simpleFormat
		formatterFunction("test")
	
	-- In the above sample code, you can see how flexible programming in Lua is,
	-- without any special additional code.


--[[
	12.3 The require Function
]]
	-- Lua has provided a high level function called require to load all the necessary modules.
	-- It is kept as simple as possible to avoid having too much information on module to load it.
	-- The require function just assumes the modules as a chunk of code that defines some values
	-- which is actually functions or tables containing functions.

	-- Example
	-- Let us consider a simple example, where one function has the math functions.
	-- Let's call this module as mymath and filename being mymath.lua.
	-- The file content is as follows âˆ’

		local mymath =  {}

		function mymath.add(a, b)
			print(a + b)
		end

		function mymath.sub(a, b)
			print(a - b)
		end

		function mymath.mul(a, b)
			print(a * b)
		end

		function mymath.div(a, b)
			print(a / b)
		end

		return mymath
	
	-- Now, in order to access this Lua module in another file, say, moduletutorial.lua,
	-- you need to use the following code segment.

		mymathmodule = require("mymath")
		mymathmodule.add(10, 20)
		mymathmodule.sub(30, 20)
		mymathmodule.mul(10, 20)
		mymathmodule.div(30, 20)

	-- In order to run this code, we need to place the two Lua files in the same directory or alternatively,
	-- you can place the module file in the package path and it needs additional setup.
	-- When we run the above program, we will get the following output.
	--[[
		30
		10
		200
		1.5
	]]
	
	
--[[	
	12.4 Things to Remember
]]
	-- * Place both the modules and the file you run in the same directory.
	-- * Module name and its file name should be the same.
	-- * It is a best practice to return modules for require function
	--   and hence the module should be preferably implemented as shown above eventhough you can find
	--   other types of implementations elsewhere.


--[[
	12.5 Old Way of Implementing Modules
]]
	-- Let me now rewrite the same example in the older way, which uses package.seeall type of implementation.
	-- This was used in Lua versions 5.1 and 5.0. The mymath module is shown below.

		module("mymath", package.seeall)

		function mymath.add(a, b)
			print(a + b)
		end

		function mymath.sub(a, b)
			print(a - b)
		end

		function mymath.mul(a, b)
			print(a * b)
		end

		function mymath.div(a, b)
			print(a / b)
		end

	-- The usage of modules in moduletutorial.lua is shown below.

		require("mymath")
		mymath.add(10, 20)
		mymath.sub(30, 20)
		mymath.mul(10, 20)
		mymath.div(30, 20)

	-- When we run the above, we will get the same output.
	-- But it is advised on to use the older version of the code and it is assumed to less secure.
	-- Many SDKs that use Lua for programming like Corona SDK has deprecated the use of this.
